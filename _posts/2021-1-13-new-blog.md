I am a kind of girl who love to write and easily get motivated in my life by my ow thoughts. Its very important to write my experience and learnings somewhere. I basically a research scholar at Civil engineering department, IIT Roorkee. 

My vision towards life changed after joining in this institute, not because of this institute, but I think its because of my team, each and every lab member is one of a kindâ€¦ I learned many things and I was lucky enough to join this lab. One of my senior  more like my elder brother guided me and helped me to solve almost all my problems. 

Yes you got me right, he suggested me about this platform and I was excited to make use of this new platform. Thus I have decided to make use of this platform to share my learnings to the world.
