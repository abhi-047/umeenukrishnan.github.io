In FEniCS we have an option of importing the mesh geometry in .xdmf format. This makes our job much more easier and simpler. As it allows us to use different packages (Gmsh, Ansys, Abaqus etc) for complex geometry modeling and meshing.

In this post I will mainly focus on Gmsh because thats what I mostly prefer to use as it is an open source  GUI based package. 

write a para about Meshx here.
